# Woodbury-Computer-Associates-Museum
A gift for you guys, in memory of Harold D. "Skip" Meade III. This repo is a collection of Woodbury Computer Associates / Woodbury Software material I was able to track down software, manuals, and vintage scans, plus quick instructions so you can actually run the Apple II stuff again.

Each folder will have its own "README" aka the instructions on how to open/run anything (only if required)
